## EDA - Customer Lifetime Value
In the world of business analytics, understanding and calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is essential. There are various approaches to calculate CLTV, and each business may have its own perspective on what's suitable. In this section, we will explore one approach.

### CLTV Formula
The CLTV formula we will explore is as follows:

__ CLTV = ((Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency) / Churn Rate) x Profit Margin. __

### 1. Calculate Average Order Value
Explanation of how to calculate Average Order Value goes here.
### 2. Calculate Purchase Frequency
Explanation of how to calculate Purchase Frequency goes here.
### 3. Calculate Repeat Rate and Churn Rate
Description of how to calculate Repeat Rate and Churn Rate.
The percentage of Repeat Rate is: 98.34%.
### 4. Calculate Profit Margin
Profit Margin represents the percentage of total sales earned as profit. Assuming a 10% profit margin for our business.
### 5. Calculate Customer Lifetime Value
The final step is to calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) based on the formula above.
This is just one approach to CLTV analysis. Your business may have its own unique considerations and metrics to calculate CLTV effectively.

## Customer Segmentation
Segmenting your customers based on their total purchase value is a powerful way to understand your customer base and tailor your marketing and business strategies effectively.

## Customers With High Transactions

### Countries with Low Cancellation of Orders
Highlighting countries with low order cancellation rates can serve as examples of effective business operations and customer satisfaction.

## Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis involves examining data collected or recorded over time to identify patterns, trends, and insights. This section focuses on understanding temporal aspects of your business data.

### Any Patterns or Trends in Count of Orders?
Analyzing the count of orders over time can reveal trends and patterns that are essential for business planning and decision-making.

### Month VS Total Purchase
Exploring the relationship between months and total purchase can provide insights into monthly variations in sales and revenue.
